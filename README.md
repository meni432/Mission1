# Mission1
This project has an algorithmic library to represent a graph, and to calculate short routes between nodes in the graph,
and in particular to calculate the shortest route between to nodes (also with a list of forbidden nodes in the way),

This algorithmic library will also be able give us some statistic calculations - calculate the radius, diameter,
it can check if the graph upholds the triangle inequality and it able to return the total runtime (ms).
