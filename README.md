# Mission1
This project has an algorithmic library to represent a graph, to calculate short routes between vertexes in the graph,
and in particular to calculate the shortest route between two vertexes (also with a list of forbidden nodes in the way).

This algorithmic library will also be able give us some statistic calculations - calculate the radius, diameter,
it can check if the graph upholds the triangle inequality and it able to return the total runtime (ms).

For an explanation on the Dijkstra algorithm, please refer to: Https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdmfOwyQlcI

Dijkstra Complexity - O(|E|+|V|log|V|)

Floydâ€“Warshall Complexity O(n^3) (for triangle inequality)
v=number of nodes; e=number of edges.

Its open source is located at the following link: http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/44sp.
In order to run it, go to the Graph_algo class and run your tests in its main().
